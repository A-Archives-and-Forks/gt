## Overview

**Locadex** is an AI agent that helps you implement internationalization in your projects.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure API Keys

Before running Locadex, you need to configure your API keys. The easiest way is to create a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-anthropic-api-key>"
GT_API_KEY="<your-gt-api-key>"
GT_PROJECT_ID="<your-gt-project-id>"
```

Alternatively, you can set them as environment variables in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-anthropic-api-key>"
export GT_API_KEY="<your-gt-api-key>"
export GT_PROJECT_ID="<your-gt-project-id>"
```

### 2. Run Locadex

The easiest way to get started is to run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npx locadex start
```

This single command will handle everything for you:
- Automatically install `locadex` if it's not already in your project.
- Run the `setup` command to initialize internationalization.
- Run the `i18n` command to launch the AI-powered assistant.

## Setting Up for Internationalization

For more granular control, you can also run the `setup` and `i18n` commands separately.

### Initialize Project

This command initializes internationalization in your project, setting up required configuration files. This includes adding a `<LocaleSelector>` component to your layout and wrapping your configuration with `withGTConfig()` to enable multilingual support.

```bash
npx locadex setup
```

### Internationalize Project

This command launches the AI-powered assistant for internationalization tasks. The assistant will guide you through your code, replacing hard-coded text with `<T>` components to make your content ready for translation.

```bash
npx locadex i18n
```
