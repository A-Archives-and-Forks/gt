# Translating JSX

This guide will walk you through how to use the [`<T>` component](/docs/next/api/components/t) to internationalize JSX content.

## How to use the `<T>` component

Let's say you have some HTML content that you want to translate.

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <p>Hello, world!</p>;
}
```

All you have to do is wrap the content in a `<T>` component.

```jsx
import { T } from 'gt-next';

function Greeting() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </T>
  );
}
```

Depending on the current language your user has selected, this will render the appropriate translation.
See [switching languages](/docs/next/guides/languages) for more information on how to allow your users to switch languages.

# Additional Options

## Context (Optional)

In some cases, you may want to provide additional context to the translation.
This can be done by passing a `context` prop to the `<T>` component.

```jsx
<T context='toast, as in a pop-up notification'>
  Click on the toast to dismiss it.
</T>
```

This is useful in cases where words may have multiple meanings depending on the context.
For example, "toast" can refer to the food or a pop-up notification.

The context prop is helpful for the AI to understand the intent of the translation.

## `id` (Optional)

You can also pass an `id` prop to the `<T>` component.
This is useful for debugging purposes and makes editing the translation easier.

```jsx
<T id='toast'>Click on the toast to dismiss it.</T>
```

# When to use the `<T>` component

While the `<T>` component is very flexible, it is not always the best solution.

You should always try to use the `<T>` component when you have any **static HTML or JSX content.**

## When not to use the `<T>` component

**DO NOT** use the `<T>` component when you have any unsafe **dynamic** content.

Here, dynamic content means any content that could change at runtime.
This rule does not apply if you are using [Variable Components](/docs/next/guides/variables) or [Branching Components](/docs/next/guides/branches).

<Callout>
  **Note:**
  
  Variable components are a special case where the content is dynamic, but the content has been wrapped and sanitized, so it is safe to use the `<T>` component.

Content wrapped in variable components are never translated directly by the `<T>` component.

</Callout>

The following examples show invalid usage of the `<T>` component:

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Your username is {username}</p>
</T>
```

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Current date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
</T>
```

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Logical Expressions: {username === 'admin' ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
</T>
```

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Conditional Rendering: {isAdmin ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
</T>
```

<Callout>
  In the above examples, the content can be safely internationalized using
  [variable components](/docs/next/guides/variables) and [branching
  components](/docs/next/guides/branches).
</Callout>

```jsx
const chatMessage = getChatMessageFromServer();
<T>
  <p>{chatMessage}</p>
</T>;
```

<Callout>
  In this example, the content is fully dynamic, so it should be translated on the server side before being passed to the client.

See the [core](/docs/core) library for more information on how to dynamically translate content via our API.

# Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `<T>` component. These are all correct.

## HTML content

### Original

```jsx
<p>Hello, world!</p>
```

### Result

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</T>
```

## Simple JSX content

### Original

```jsx
<Button>Click me!</Button>
```

### Result

```jsx
<T>
  <Button>Click me!</Button>
</T>
```

## Complex JSX content

### Original

```jsx
<Tooltip>
  <TooltipTrigger>
    <div className='flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-destructive px-3 py-1.5 text-sm text-destructive-foreground'>
      <AlertCircle className='h-4 w-4' />
      <span>Free Usage</span>
    </div>
  </TooltipTrigger>
  <TooltipContent>
    <p>
      You are nearing your free monthly limit. Please upgrade your plan to avoid
      any disruptions to your service.
    </p>
  </TooltipContent>
</Tooltip>
```

### Result

```jsx
<T>
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger>
      <div className='flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-destructive px-3 py-1.5 text-sm text-destructive-foreground'>
        <AlertCircle className='h-4 w-4' />
        <span>Free Usage</span>
      </div>
    </TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent>
      <p>
        You are nearing your free monthly limit. Please upgrade your plan to
        avoid any disruptions to your service.
      </p>
    </TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
</T>
```

<Callout>
  The `<T>` component can handle any nested content in the same component.
</Callout>

# Common Pitfalls

## Direct descendants only

The `<T>` component only translates text passed directly as a child.
This means that if you have content inside a component that is not directly passed to `<T>`, it will not be translated.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```jsx copy
function UntranslatedContent() {
  return <p>This content is not translated</p>;
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
  return (
    <T>
      <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
      <UntranslatedContent />
    </T>
  );
}
```

In this example, the content inside `<UntranslatedContent>` will not be translated.
Only the content directly inside `<T>` will be translated, like the `<h1>` tag and its children.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why does this happen?">
    This occurs because of how React renders components.
    It is a bit complicated, but the gist is that React does not know the content of a component until it has rendered.
    Therefore, the contents of components like `<UntranslatedContent>` are not translated.
    However, any text directly between the two `<T>` tags will be translated.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
<Callout>
  **Note:** A good rule of thumb is that any content that is *literally* between the two `<T>` tags in the file will be translated.
  You can always add another `<T>` to translate the content that is not being translated, though nesting `<T>` components is not recommended.
</Callout>

## What's the fix?

Wrap the text in the `<T>` component directly, like so:

```jsx copy
function TranslatedContent() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>
        This content <b>IS</b> translated
      </p>
    </T>
  );
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
  return (
    <>
      <T>
        <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
      </T>
      <TranslatedContent />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Nested `<T>` Components

Nesting `<T>` components is not allowed.
Because of React's rendering system, this can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues.

Here is an example of **what not to do**:

```jsx copy
function SomeComponent() {
  return <T>Hello, friend!</T>;
}

export default function NestedTranslation() {
  return (
    <T>
      <T>
        {' '}
        {/* Don't do this! */}
        Hello, world!
      </T>
      <SomeComponent /> {/* This still counts. Don't do this! */}
    </T>
  );
}
```

The solution here is to remove the outtermost `<T>` component.

## Translating dynamic content

If you attempt to wrap dynamic content with the `<T>` component, the CLI tool will error.

For example, the following will error:

```jsx
const username = 'John Doe';
<T>
  <p>Your username is {username}</p>
</T>;
```

To get around this, try to use [Variable Components](/docs/next/guides/variables) or [Branching Components](/docs/next/guides/branches) to wrap the dynamic content.

Alternatively, if your content truly is dynamic and needs to be translated on-demand,
you can use the [`<Tx>` component](/docs/next/guides/dynamic-content).

# Summary

- `<T>` components are used to internationalize arbitrary JSX Content.
- `<T>` components should not be used for dynamic content, without using variable components or branching components.
- In development, the `<T>` component will translate content on-demand.
- In production, all translations that the `<T>` component uses are completed at build time.
